This post tracks my ongoing senior capstone project: an electric vehicle battery management and swapping system designed to keep equipment running continuously through rapid battery exchange and robust state-of-health/state-of-charge monitoring.

Project hub and documentation are maintained here: [Team-O-Matic-2025 GitHub repository](https://github.com/dairyking98/Team-O-Matic-2025).

## Project Scope

- Develop a modular battery pack architecture with safe, tool-less swapping
- Implement battery management for real-time SoC/SoH estimation and fault detection
- Design the mechanical docking/exchange interface and operator workflow
- Integrate embedded control, power electronics, and safety interlocks
- Validate performance with prototype testing and iteration

## Timeline

- Fall 2025 → Spring 2026 (active, ongoing)
- First prototype window: November 6 – December 19, 2025 (per Gantt)
- Final deliverables due by end of Spring 2026

## Team and Roles

- Ben — Hardware and control; hands-on build and integration
- Mohammed — SolidWorks and mechanical design
- Sam — Microcontroller processing and DSP; hands-on build
- Leonard — Fabrication (plastic/metal/welding), Fusion 360, circuitry and microcontrollers, and AI-assisted workflows

## Planned Deliverables

- Functional prototype battery pack and swap dock
- Embedded BMS firmware and data logging
- Safety and compliance review against relevant standards
- Bill of materials, budget, and manufacturability notes
- Demo showing continuous operation via battery swaps

## Status (as of Nov 2025)

- Repository set up with scope, standards, and planning artifacts (charter, WBS, Gantt)
- Early hardware and interface concepts under review; prototyping plans in progress
- Next: finalize requirements for first prototype, order long-lead components, and begin mechanical/firmware bring-up

I'll continue to update this post with milestones, links to design artifacts, test data, and demo media as the project progresses. For the most current documentation, check the repo: [Team-O-Matic-2025](https://github.com/dairyking98/Team-O-Matic-2025).

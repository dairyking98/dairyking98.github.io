I designed and built a large-format vernier caliper as an educational tool that demonstrates precision measurement concepts at a scale that's easy to see and understand.

## Design and CAD

- Created the caliper beam outline and bracket geometry in Fusion 360
- Exported brackets as STL for printing; caliper outline as DXF for laser cutting

## Fabrication

- Laser-cut and 3D-printed the vernier parts in 1/4" MDF
- Printed the brackets in PETG for durability and stiffness
- Engraved the scales after cutting and completed assembly

## Scale Generation

- Wrote a short Python script to generate an inch rule with 0.1" main divisions
- Generated a matching vernier scale to achieve 0.01" measurement resolution

## Result

- Fully functional up to 33 inches
- Measures to 0.01"
- Highly effective as a hands-on instructional/learning tool
